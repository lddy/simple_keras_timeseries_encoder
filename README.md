see https://github.com/lddy/neighbours_hat for dataset details

models.py: MHA + FF attention block and encoder-only transformer definition + helper functions for training
model_definitions.py: parameters for the model and the training loop (edit to adjust model construction)

main.py: executes data shaping, model training and evaluation

jupyter notebook file: simplified step-by-step implementation
